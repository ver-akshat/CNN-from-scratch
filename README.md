# CNN-from-scratch
Trying to implement a Convolution Neural Network from scracth usimg Python and numpy.
This is only a basic implementation of CNN which is not highly optimized as compared to vectorized implementation, so it may take some time to execute thee script.
Here implementing 3 basic classes : Convolution,Softmax and MaxPooling layer which does the same thing as their name suggests.
Testing this on MNIST dataset which comes pre bundled with tensorflow. 
The accuracy obtained is ~99% on test data.
