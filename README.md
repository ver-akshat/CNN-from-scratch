# CNN-from-scratch
Trying to implement a Convolution Neural Network from scracth usimg Python and numpy
This is only a basic implementation of CNN which is not optimized, I will upload more optimized implementataions also
Here implementing 3 basic classes : Convolution,Softmax and MaxPooling layer which does the same thing as their name suggests
Testing this on MNIST dataset which comes pre bundled with tensorflow 
The accuracy obtained is ~99% on test data.
